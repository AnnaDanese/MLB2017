### Venue: Fondazione Edmund Mach, Trento

### Date: TBD (July 2017)

### Duration: 4 days

### Description:
The course will provide a full bioinformatic workflow for molecular profiling through preprocessing, machine learning and network visualization with R and Python.

Data preparation: from GEO datasets (e.g., microarray and RNA-seq) to data matrix via \*nix shell scripting

Data exploration and preprocessing: qualitative analysis; filtering, centering and scaling of predictors

Classification basics: machine learning, model selection, and prediction

The Data Analysis Plan (DAP) - intro to unbiased pipelines for (binary) classification: theory and implementation of a basic DAP in Python (Scikit-Learn) with feature ranking and classification

Performance measures and diagnostic plots - Accuracy, MCC, Stability: theory and graphics in R (ggplot2) and Matplotlib

Differential network analysis -- co-expression networks, graph comparison, community detection: theory and examples in R/Python,

visualization by the igraph library and use of the ReNette web interface.

The course will be highly interactive and the students will continuously put theory into practice while learning. By the end of the course, the participants will ... . Basic Unix/Linux skills is a requirement.



### Prerequisites: basics of R, Python, \*nix (Unix or Linux) shell. Basic statistical knowledge
